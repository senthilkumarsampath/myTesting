<root><para>&lt;para alignment="JUSTIFY (3)" ele-id="1DF65D10" space_after="6.0"&gt; The diversity of photopigments, light-harvesting protein complexes, and their different regulatory mechanisms contrasts with the high homology of the photosynthetic RCs within the phylogenetic classification (Blankenship, 2010). Light-harvesting or antenna systems have evolved to adapt to a variable intensity and spectral qualities of light in diverse environments and are divided into inner and outer antenna systems (Table 2). The inner antenna is an essential component of RCs. In contrast, the outer antenna systems include multiple photopigment-bound protein families having different pigments and pigment-protein complexes. The light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) in plants and other eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms belong to a single protein family and bind 15-22 chlorophylls. LHCs make up the outer antenna system and are composed of three membrane-spanning proteins. Cyanobacteria lack members of the LHC family and instead use a soluble antenna, comprising phycobiliproteins or six-transmembrane Chl-binding proteins (CBP) as their main light-harvesting system (Chen&lt;emphasis role="cs_italic"&gt;&lt;emphasis role="italic"&gt; et al.&lt;/emphasis&gt;&lt;/emphasis&gt; 2008; Mirkovic &lt;emphasis role="cs_italic"&gt;&lt;emphasis role="italic"&gt;et al&lt;/emphasis&gt;&lt;/emphasis&gt;. 2017). Three important parameters decide optimisation and efficiency of antenna systems, 1, the distance between photopigments; 2, the orientation of photopigments;  and 3, spectral overlap between the pigments. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;senthil&lt;/para&gt;<REF_CITE start_index="223" end_index="227">2010</REF_CITE><TABLE_CITE start_index="422" end_index="429">Table 2</TABLE_CITE><REF_CITE start_index="1078" end_index="1094">Chen et al. 2008</REF_CITE><REF_CITE start_index="1096" end_index="1116">Mirkovic et al. 2017</REF_CITE></para></root>
