I see the notions of conflict and rising as a pair of actions. One occurs in relation to the other. First James and John (and Elijah) appear in context of religio-spiritual conflict. As precursor, Elijah acts according to divine command against Ahaziah, king of Judah, who introduces offensive forms of worship. James and John respond to conflict with the Samaritans and their rejection of Jesus as Jesus sets his face to Jerusalem, the place of his execution. On the mountain, the twins with Peter are given new names, an action with apocalyptic meaning. See Revelation 22.4: “They shall see his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads.” In Mark 1.29-30, James and John with Andrew and Simon are with Jesus, who heals Simon’s mother-in-law of fever—puressousa, “fevering” (root pura, “fiery”)—a scene that takes place still resonant with Jesus’ public fight with the unclean spirit(s) in Mark 1.21-28. The Transfiguration account anticipates Jesus’ death, articulated in Mark 8.31: “And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected.” This notion of “opposition” seems choreographed in Mark 13.1-9 as Jesus, with the twins, sits on the Mount of Olives “opposite” (katenanti) the Temple and speaks of the chaos of forthcoming destruction as well as suffering of the twins, Peter, and Andrew. In Mark 10.38-39, as the disciples and Jesus are going up to the Temple, Jesus clearly states that he himself and James and John will “drink the cup.” In Mark 5.35-43, James and John, along with Peter, enter the house of Jarius amid tumult and ridicule, to heal the daughter of Jarius, who is “sleeping.” In Mark 14.32-42, Jesus enters the Garden of Gethsemane with James and John: “And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled.

The sons of Zeus also have the power of fire from heaven as “glorious…deliverers of humans,” as told in the ancient Homeric Hymn 33. In a storm they manifest like spirits round the vertical mast of a ship—also known as St. Elmo’s Fire.
