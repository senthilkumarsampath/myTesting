Other details:
    • © The Editors and Contributors Severally.
    • Second edition (PDF of first edition included in Admin folder for reference).
    • Contributed volume so edit for consistency within chapters.
    • ToC to follow usual EE layout. The ToC supplied in author files is for info only (remove author affiliations from prelims and info re whether chapters are new/revised/unchanged etc.).
    • There is a ‘Lloyd’s page’ in the prelims (to follow the list of contributors). See first edn for style. I will pass the Lloyd’s logo on when I have it.
    • Abstracts and keywords are supplied for each chapter for the metadata spreadsheet but are not to appear in the book itself.
    • Please add part title pages as per ToC.
    • Add full points to the end of footnotes where missing.
    • Remove author affiliations/contact details from chapter opening pages.
    • Add chapter numbers to ch. opening pages where missing.
    • Footnote numbering to start from 1 in each chapter (house style avoids using asterisked footnotes, please renumber from 1 and amend cross-references accordingly).
    • Change any endnotes to footnotes.
    • Use en rules (not hyphens) for number spans.
    • Prefer single quotation marks to double (double for a quote within a quote).
    • Quotes should be roman not italic (unless for emphasis).
    • There are some odd bits of coding in some chapters – this can be removed. 
    • Where new footnotes have been added, please check note renumbering and update cross-refs accordingly.
    • Figure and table numbers to be prefixed with chapter number as per usual convention.
